rsstool_php/   PHP code that demonstrates how the feeds collected by RSStool can be used in own sites

xmlget/        small tool for using XPath queries on XML documents
                 can be downloaded from http://rsstool.berlios.de

rsstool2sql.php  script to convert rsstool proprietary XML into SQL

crc/           crc8(), crc16(), crc24() and crc32 (re-)implementations in C and PHP
                 with identical output

soundex/       soundex() (re-)implementations in C and PHP with identical output
                 NOTE: because soundex() is not a checksum but rather a very lossy
                         speechcodec there are as many different implementations
                         of soundex() as there are languages
                       So do use these soundex() functions or your own implementation
                        or just go with good old crc for creating a keyword index and
                        avoid language hell
